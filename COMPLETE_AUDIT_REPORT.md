## ⚠️ What Needs Fixing - Critical Issues

### **1. API Syntax Errors (BLOCKING PRODUCTION)**
❌ **Multiple route files have missing closing braces**:
- `/api/users/[id]/route.ts`: Lines 14, 90, 104, 113, 125
- `/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts`: Lines 106, 122, 136, 147, 164, 192, 203, 244
- `/api/jobs/[id]/applications/route.ts`: 40+ missing braces
- `/api/gigs/[id]/route.ts`: Lines 100, 106, 158, 164, 171, etc.
- `/api/payments/[id]/escrow/route.ts`: Lines 31, 71, 74, 78, etc.

**Impact**: Build fails, production deployment impossible
**Fix Time**: 30-60 minutes

### **2. Smart Contract Integration (MISSING)**
❌ **IDL Definition Missing**: Frontend cannot interact with smart contract
```typescript
// Currently: {} as Idl (BROKEN)
// Needs: Proper IDL generated from Rust contract
```
**Fix**: Generate IDL with `anchor build` and integrate properly

### **3. Security Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK)**
❌ **Insecure nonce generation** using Math.random()
❌ **No rate limiting** on authentication endpoints  
❌ **Missing security headers** (CSRF, XSS protection)
❌ **No session timeout** handling

---

## 🔄 What's Partially Done - Needs Completion

### **1. Testing Framework (0% Complete)**
- No unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests
- **Recommendation**: Add Jest/Vitest + Playwright
- **Critical** for handling real money transactions

### **2. Missing API Endpoints**
Several endpoints referenced in frontend but not implemented:
- `/api/users/check-username/route.ts`
- `/api/users/settings/*`
- `/api/wallet/withdraw/route.ts`
- Individual resource management endpoints

### **3. Error Handling & Recovery**
- Limited rollback mechanisms for failed blockchain transactions
- Inconsistent error response formats
- No comprehensive logging system

### **4. Performance Optimization**
- Missing database indexes for common queries
- No caching layer (Redis recommended)
- Bundle size optimization needed
