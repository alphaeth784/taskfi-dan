   - Insufficient parameterization

3. **Information Disclosure**
   - Generic error messages hide validation details
   - Stack traces may leak in development

4. **Authorization Bypass**
   - Inconsistent ownership validation
   - Missing admin role verification in some routes

5. **Input Validation Gaps**
   - File upload size limits not enforced
   - Missing sanitization of user content

### **Medium Priority:**
1. Missing CORS configuration
2. No audit logging for admin actions
3. Weak password policies (if implemented)
4. Missing request timeout handling
